## Why I created md2page

The purpose to create **md2page** was to find a simplest way to host a personal website. There are some existing site generators, like Jekyll and Material for MkDocs, but I think they're not simple enough.

I used to take note using MicroSoft OneNote, which was easy to use and powerful. But I found the problem when my subscription expired and wanted to transfer all my notes to another platform. It was not easy, as OneNote has its own format. So I decided to use Markdown to take note, which I can store the notes anywhere without platform limitation.

Futher more, I want to share my notes in my personal blog, as I don't need any fancy themes, just the simplest personal website, I chose Github page and tried **Jekyll** and **Material for MkDocs** to transform my markdown notes into html pages. Aftr playing with these two tools for a while, I decided to create my own tool to generate personal pages.

### Advantages of md2page

- You can just click the html file to verify the page, no need to host it like 127.0.0.1:8000
- No need to setup Github action

### Disadvantage of md2page

- This is just a initial version, the index page is super simple

### What to expect in the further versions

- More beautiful index page
