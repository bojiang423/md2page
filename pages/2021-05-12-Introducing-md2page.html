<h1>Markdown to Pages</h1><hr><h1>Introducing md2page</h1>
<h2>Why I created md2page</h2>
<p>The purpose to create <strong>md2page</strong> was to find a simplest way to host a personal website. There are some existing site generators, like Jekyll and Material for MkDocs, but I think they're not simple enough.</p>
<p>I used to take note using MicroSoft OneNote, which was easy to use and powerful. But I found the problem when my subscription expired and wanted to transfer all my notes to another platform. It was not easy, as OneNote has its own format. So I decided to use Markdown to take note, which I can store the notes anywhere without platform limitation.</p>
<p>Futher more, I want to share my notes in my personal blog, as I don't need any fancy themes, just the simplest personal website, I chose Github page and tried <strong>Jekyll</strong> and <strong>Material for MkDocs</strong> to transform my markdown notes into html pages. Aftr playing with these two tools for a while, I decided to create my own tool to generate personal pages.</p>
